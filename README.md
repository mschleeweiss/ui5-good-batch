## To Do

* [x] Add sticky header to master view
* [x] Add "delete all entries" function to sticky header
* [x] Change master layout to mimic "Network" tab (no bottom-border, instead use different bg-color for every other row, blueish hover color, blue select color)
* [x] Change font-size/family of master view (maybe roboto mono?)
* [ ] Add color scheme for light mode
